## Introduction

If you reading this, you may familiar with code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime or IDEs like Dev C++, Pycharm,... And one thing they all have in common is that they are heavy and slow. Sure some of them are indeed light-weight and some are heavy because of built-in stuff in them, but what if I says Neovim can do the same but better and faster?

### So What Is Neovim?

Neovim is a highly extensible keyboard-based editor on terminal where your mouse is almost completely useless, and because of that it's can improve your productivity by not touching the mouse. Neovim originally come from Vim or Vi and also a drop-in replacement of it, mean Neovim are 99% identical to Vim but most of it's code base are refactored to be better, this also help the community to make faster and stronger plugins for Neovim.

### Why use Neovim?

When you first open up Neovim and what first pop up is: 

(image later)

You may ask: "Why would this post tell me Neovim could do better than any editor I use, I literally can't write anything, how can I move around, I can't do anything and **HOW DO I EXIT THIS**".

That's because you haven't set everything up so it's can usable. Neovim is only strong and effective when you learn how to use it and spent time using it and of course you have to install plugins in it.

Anyways there is **3 reasons** why I pick Neovim for my daily coding editor:

1. Neovim is insanely fast in writing code and move around it.
2. The Neovim customization is beyond your own limits (or someone else config).
3. Neovim is light-weight which can be use in everywhere (especially server).
